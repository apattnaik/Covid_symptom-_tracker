Heart rate sensing: For heart rate sensing we will utilize the back camera of the smartphone with flash enabled. We will take 45 s video from the back camera with the flash on. While taking the video the user should softly press their index finger on the camera lens while covering the flash light. From the variation of the red coloration in the image we will derive the heart rate of the subject.

Respiratory rate: For respiratory rate sensing we will utilize the accelerometer or orientation sensor of the smartphone. The user will be asked to lay down and place the smartphone on their chest for a period of 45 seconds. The respiratory rate will be computed from the accelerometer or orientation data.
